<h2>‘Sokrates wollte sterben’: Volition-Lexicon in Nietzsche versus Obligation-Lexicon in Plato’s <em>Phaedo</em></h2>

<p>
Preparing a commentary on Nietzsche’s sentence «Sokrates wollte sterben: nicht Athen …» and engaging with the secondary literature on Nietzsche’s <em>Sokrates-Typus</em> (type of Socrates).
</p>

<p>
In German narrative prose, the clause «Sokrates wollte sterben» (preterite of the verb <em>wollen</em> plus infinitive) presents Socrates’ death as an act of resolved volition, with his will directed toward dying. The form <em>wollte sterben</em> functions as an explicit volition-lexicon (<em>Willenslexikon</em>), foregrounding intention and decision.
</p>

<p>
The French rendering «Socrate voulait mourir» (imparfait of <em>vouloir</em> plus infinitive) instead suggests an ongoing inner state, a durative disposition “to want to die” rather than a single, sharply bounded decision. The effect is closer to a condition of suicidality (<em>Suizidalität</em>) than to a single decisive act (<em>Entschluss</em>).
</p>

<p>
Both formulations stand in contrast to Plato’s <em>Phaedo</em>, where the closing scene presents the cluster «ὀφείλομεν, ἀπόδοτε, μὴ ἀμελήσητε, τὸ φάρμακον ἔπιεν» for the act of drinking the hemlock. The lexical field here is that of cultic obligation and debt: “we owe” (ὀφείλομεν), “pay back / render what is owed” (ἀπόδοτε), “do not neglect” (μὴ ἀμελήσητε), combined with the description that “he drank the <em>pharmakon</em>” (τὸ φάρμακον ἔπιεν).
</p>

<p>
On a conjectural reading, φάρμακον (with its semantic ambivalence “poison” / “remedy”) together with the cock owed to Asclepius (normally a thank-offering after healing in the Asclepius cult) can be taken to encode the pattern “life as sickness, death as cure”. This formula, however, is not stated explicitly in Plato and remains an interpretive construction built on cultic context and later philosophical reception.
</p>

<p>
Plato thus stages the death of Socrates within a framework of obligation: legal and moral obligation in the dialogue <em>Crito</em>, and a cultic debt-lexicon in the <em>Phaedo</em>. Nietzsche, by contrast, recasts the scene using an explicit lexicon of will and volition — the sentence «Sokrates wollte sterben» — which foregrounds volition over legal or cultic obligation and presents the death as self-willed rather than merely administered.
